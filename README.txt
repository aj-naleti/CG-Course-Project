# CG Course Project
 
## Assignment 1 deliverables:

### Theme: 
- Post apocalyptic/abandoned slightly futuristic alley platformer.
- Lots of concrete, old tiled floors, old buildings with some hologram signs that were broken.

### Illumination:
- Specular bump: To have a shiny material that also appears to have depth
- Diffuse: Basic lighting
- Specular: Basic metallic
- Toon: Give shading to character's pants
- Ambient: Simple lighting

### Effects:
- Pixelation to give an old-school feel
- Hologram: To give a futuristic feel
- Specular bump: To have metallic objects that shine
- Rim tint: To have objects stand out

## Improvements:
- Completely re-made the scene using free models on Sketchfab (old one was just metal walls with no personality)
- Found new textures and normal maps and made extra materials to fit the theme
- Made "Floor" material using Substance Designer (because I couldn't find anything that fit good enough)
- Darkened the lighting in general so the hologram signs and platforms would pop out
- Everything here was done to boost the isolating and abandoned vibe I was going for
